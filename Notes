# NEXT TO DO

# clear everything on SC_Window once submit button clicked
# figure out the UI
# space some things out on the UI

tkinter module has this thing called insert for text entries (text inputs)
the cursor starts in a certain box as soon as the app is booted

Things I learned while doing this project
    - I think I improved a lot on my problem solving, I think I feel a little more fluent
    - I learned helpful list methods     .insert()    and       .remove()
    - I got a whole lot of practice with files (reading/writing to files)
    - logic flow


Examples
    - Talking to my dad about this project helped me realize that I don't need to put all the patients in every single line they want to go in
        I can put them in one by one. tip: when you have a real life problem, manually solve the problem, like do it with paper with labels

    - I had yet another problem with my sorting algorithm, and that was when I realized I needed to put patients into the shortest line
        I made it overly confusing. I found the lengths of all the lists. Then sorted them shorter to longer. Then, I would have a dictionary
        where I would put a length and find the name of the service. {length:service_name}

        The problem was, some line lengths were the same length.

        if the dictionary was ordered Dental, Mental, Oriental     2, 2, 5
        then when I plugged in the number, imagine 2, it would always stop at Dental and never pass on to Mental

        the solution was actually pretty simple.

        The strange part was that I kept the lengths in a list, sorted them, pass the list of lengths into another function,
        then matched them up with their service (using the dictionary)

        But I could have just done this:  keep the lengths in a list, sort them, match them up with the dictionary, and pass
        a list of service names into a function

        But I just realized this, like just now. what if the line lengths are the same. A dictionary can't have keys that are teh same!?

        ...some time later...

        My solution is this. I did some crazy list matching and I think it'll work


Progress for simplifications:
    pyqt5 UI- 250 lines         tkinter UI - 70 lines
    now, we use the tkinter variables (stringVar() etc) so we don't have to open the Line Window over and over again

Just a clarification.
Saving the permanent data will be done in the .csv file
defining patients = {} and locating for entering lines will be saved in the json
