# Purpose
HealthExpo is a digital pager to manage patients wanting to visit different hospital departments.

## Data Organization
Saving the permanent data will be done in the .csv file

### Line Window
It is supposed to be pulled up on a monitor in the lobby. It shows all the patients waiting in the lobby when they'll be next. (Think of the screen at the DMV where it shows who it is serving).


### Actual service
June 2nd, 2024 HealthExpo
We served about 160 people in the Knoxville area. A variety of doctors came to help. We also received help from volunteers, mostly from our church.
