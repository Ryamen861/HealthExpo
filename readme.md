# Purpose
HealthExpo is a digital pager to manage patients wanting to visit different hospital departments.

## Notes to Self
clear everything on SC_Window once submit button clicked?
entry.focus_set()

Things/Tips I learned while making this project:
    Tip: in a program that must be implemented in real life, try manually solving the problem on paper with labels
                Identify I/O, processes needed

## Data Organization
Saving the permanent data will be done in the .csv file
defining patients = {} and locating for entering lines will be saved in the json

## Future Ideas?
Log File? <br>
CLI tool to reset databases, index file, lines <br>
auto update line window <br>
reset SC window inputs after "Submit" button pressed <br>
