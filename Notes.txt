Notes from last coding session:
Finish up line window (patient id's are not showing)
Figure out if "re-enter" method is working correctly
What size is the other monitor (Samsung TV)
    Trouble shoot on that screen, adjust fonts and spacing for it
Add error handling to line_window and when it comes to removing patients
    There was for sure one error when I tested it with David
    Get David to download the program on his machine
Make finishing touches to UI, it does NOT look good, particularly the SC window, also kind of the Line window

When we have multiple services at one time (like foot massage), we should use either color or boldness to show which ones are in


eye || ahn-kkwah
dental
oriental
internal medicine
foot massage 3

## Future Ideas?
Tool to reset databases, index file, lines
reset SC window inputs after "Submit" button pressed
once submit button clicked? 
entry.focus_set()

Add korean/images (image of eye, teeth) to line window list names (Dental Chik-wah)

ICO files (logo) does not work on mac, need xbm

Write a note at the bottom - "If your number is first in line, please enter the correlated service room"
